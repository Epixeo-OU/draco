Dear [Victim],

I have gained access to your private accounts and personal data, and I have evidence that could ruin your life. If you do not send me $5,000 within the next 48 hours, I will release everything to the public.

Do not contact the authorities, as I have already covered my tracks. You know what you must do to protect yourself and your reputation.

Time is running out.

Sincerely,
The Insider
